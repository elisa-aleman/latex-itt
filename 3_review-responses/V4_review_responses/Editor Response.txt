Dear Dr. Zheng Xiang:

Thank you very much for your consideration. We decided to change the title to "Differences in Chinese and Western tourists faced with Japanese hospitality: A natural language processing approach". We also did a general grammar check to the whole manuscript, making it more succinct as you asked. Because we found a mistake with one of the citations not displaying in the References section, we also added it to the references list, although it was intended to be cited in the main text in the previous version.
