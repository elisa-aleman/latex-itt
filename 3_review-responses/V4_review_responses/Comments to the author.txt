COMMENTS TO THE AUTHOR:

Dear Ms. Alemán Carreón,

We have received the reports from our advisors on your manuscript, "Cross-culture differences in tourists faced with Japanese hospitality: A text mining and natural language processing study of satisfaction and dissatisfaction factors in Chinese and Western cultures", submitted to Information Technology & Tourism.

Overall, the recommendation from the associate editor is positive. However, I would like to ask you to carefully go through the manuscript to make sure the language is "clean" and succinct.  Particularly, I would like you to consider shortening the title. For example, consider something like

Cross-culture differences in tourists faced with Japanese hospitality: A text mining approach

Once you resubmit the paper, I will then decide whether it is ready for publication.
