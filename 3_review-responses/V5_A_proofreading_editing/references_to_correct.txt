Kindly check and confirm the inserted publisher location for the reference Hofstede 1984, Stone et al. 1966
Hofstede 1984 seems to be mistaken, publisher: SAGE, London.

Stone et al. 1966 is published by MIT press, but upon checking again, I could not find a reference to the published location.

Kindly provide the volume number and page range for the reference Likert 1932, Mattila 1999, Oliver 1981
This paper is in the APA database as "Likert, R. (1932). A technique for the measurement of attitudes. Archives of Psychology, 22 140, 55." So the Volume is 22 and the page is 55, but I wasn't sure what the 140 means in this citation.


Mattila 1999 I found in APA style as. "Mattila, A. S. (1999). The role of culture and purchase motivation in service encounter evaluations. Journal of Services Marketing, 13, 376-389". So the volume is 13 and pages 376-389.

Oliver 1981 I found in the APA database as "
Oliver, R. L. (1981). Measurement and evaluation of satisfaction processes in retail settings. Journal of Retailing, 57(3), 25–48". So it is Volume 57, Issue 3, pages 25-48.
