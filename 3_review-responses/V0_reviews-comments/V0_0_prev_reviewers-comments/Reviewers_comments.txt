Title: Quantitative ranking of satisfaction and dissatisfaction factors based on text mining of online reviews from Chinese and English speaking tourists visiting Japan. 

Overview and general recommendation

Text and data mining analysis is getting important more and more as online reviews have impact on consumers' purchasing and decision behaviors. As author(s) noted, this technique has advantages in understanding consumer behavior, opinions, and sentiment about company's products, in tourism and hospitality context, consumer's consumption of services or experiences. Because of this, I think the current study is on a topic of relevance and general interest to the readers of the journal. 

Nonetheless, I found the paper to be little contributing to the literature of tourism and hospitality as it stands. While the methodology used in the study makes it interesting to read this study, the paper reveals so many problems and concerns that can't be fixed by simple revisions. In my opinion, every section needs to be rewritten. One of major problems of the paper is misalignment of each section and inconsistency that runs through the paper. For example, while the author(s) states that "the research objective of this study is to determine the factors influencing the satisfaction or dissatisfaction of Chinese customers as well as studying English speaking customers of Japanese Hotels…"(p.4), the study heavily focuses on the description of the text and data mining analysis in the most sections including the introduction, related work section, methodology, and results. No theoretical or conceptual foundation/advance of satisfaction/dissatisfaction has discussed or
suggested in the paper. Instead, most part of the manuscript, especially methodology section, write about technical aspect of the text and data mining analysis in too much detail. If this study aims to discuss methodological issues of the text and data mining analysis, the research objective should be revised to reflect that goal and the paper can be submitted to more proper journals that deal with such a topic. 

Overall, I think the description of the methodology is overly detailed without points for readers to know. On the other hand, the description of some very important points was inadequate or completely missing. Because of this, it is very confusing to understand what the study aims for. The title alludes that "rankings of satisfaction and dissatisfaction factors" but the results section does not clearly present to understand rankings of satisfaction/dissatisfaction factors. It also creates expectation of comparison between two cultural groups: Chinese-speaking tourists and English-speaking tourists. The analysis and results do not provide any significant or meaningful outcome in this regard. The introduction misleads readers to capture what the study is about, what research questions are, and why they matter. Tourism literature has a plenty of work done in the area of satisfaction/ dissatisfaction research but the literature review is incomprehensive and inconsistent with
their research objective. It is not tied to the study's main notion of satisfaction/dissatisfaction. Rather, it is more about the method.  As the author(s) argued, those studies may have done by survey methods (p. 5, line 20-21). There are several points where the author(s) revealed their intent to emphasize the advantages of their method of text and data mining analysis over survey methods. Since the manuscript is describing their method more than their main concepts, I think it might be better for the study to focus on the methodology (e.g., comparison between survey methods and text/data mining analysis, or empirically testing the advantages of text/data mining analysis over survey data, and so on). Again, while the study described a very complicated aspect of the method, the study produced a very basic analysis and weak results. Results section is very weak and mixed with data analysis section. 

In addition, many parts of the manuscript are misplaced. Most writings in the results section seem to belong to data analysis section and some portions in the discussion section deem to be placed in the results section. Most findings of the study are not well presented in the tables or described in the narratives. Tables do not present in a way to provide meaningful and interpretable outcomes.    

Because of the problems aforementioned, I have no confidence to recommend this paper for publication at this time. The paper can be resubmitted for new review when it is re-focused and rewritten.




Reviewer #2: This paper does have merits. I find the enquiry quite relevant and important and the methods used quite innovative. However, there are some major issues to be addressed before progressing publishing in Tourism Management Perspectives. I have outlined a number of suggestions and comments that I hope will be helpful to the authors in their future endeavours.
     First, the current manuscript can be improved by better writing. 
*   The title might need to be modified. The current one is bit long winded and confused. Please consider this option: "Analysing preferences differences between Chinese and English speakers in Japan hotel staying: A text mining method"
*   The current abstract as well as the introduction of the paper do not provide a bird's eye view (snapshot view) of what is being discussed throughout the paper. The reader is likely to be clueless and confused about the contents. For example, in the abstract, "Because of its effect on the Japanese economy, there is a need for the use of newer research tools that are cost and time effective and use online reviews, which increasingly affect sales…" First, this is such a long sentence. Second, what is the logic behind stating "Because of its effect on the Japanese economy, there is a need for the use of newer research tools that are cost and time effective"? Third, I believe this sentence can be split into two short statements and you may want to say "Analysing online reviews is critical to have a better understanding of specific preferences of Chinese and English speaking customers".
*   The points in the Highlights section are fine, and can be improved with more explicit statements.
*   The first sentence of the research objectives section is bit long winded. Please consider to divide it into a few short but strong sentences.
     Second, the literature review can be improved by conducting a better literature search and review, which could support the gap in the literature and add support to how this study adds value. Specifically, on Page 5, the author/s stated "There has not been yet a study that focuses on the conceptual words that are tied with the satisfaction or dissatisfaction of the user base", which might not be true. Here are some recent papers that may help:
*   Kim, B., Kim, S., & Heo, C. Y. (2016). Analysis of satisfiers and dissatisfiers in online hotel reviews on social media. International journal of contemporary hospitality management, 28(9), 1915-1936.
*   Kim, B., Kim, S., & Heo, C. Y. (2019). Consequences of customer dissatisfaction in upscale and budget hotels: Focusing on dissatisfied customers' attitude toward a hotel. International Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Administration, 20(1), 15-46.
You may consider to elaborate on what can be learned from prior studies on this topic. Then highlight what's new in your study and how your research can extend the extant research. 
You may also wish to elaborate this paper with some theoretical basis, e.g. Herzberg's two-factor theory (lower level in satisfaction does not mean dissatisfaction.
      Third, methodology used for the study is brilliant but still can be improved with better descriptions. 
*   For example, could you provide a more detailed explanation of "entropy-based mathematical extraction method"? How this method works? What is the advantage of this method? Why this method is appropriate to the current research?
*   How you defined satisfaction and dissatisfaction when analysing data? 
         Fourth, it would improve the manuscript if the author(s) explain the results more clearly and how these contribute specifically to theory development and managerial practice.
         Fifth, the paper needs to carefully proofread and edited.
