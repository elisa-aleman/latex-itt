More specifically, it attempts to investigate whether there are differences in the way Italians, Americans, and Chinese travelers perceive and emphasize several hotel attributes, even when including hotel star ratings and travelers’ profiles in the analysis. Based on a random sample of 9000 online reviews, the study adopted text link analysis to extrapolate the frequencies of predefined hotel attributes on which the multivariate analyses and tests were performed. Answers are provided to two research questions: Do travelers from different countries place different emphasis on hotel attributes? Do travelers from different countries perceive hotel attributes differently? The results suggest that the differences in perceptions and emphasis are significant. The adopted text-mining method could help hotel business managers to hear the voices of consumers and include them in performance evaluation and service design processes.}

Precisely capturing and correctly understanding the cultural difference will help tourism managers generate greater customer satisfaction and increased business revenue. To this end, this paper uncovers and compares the motivation and satisfaction of restaurant tourist customers coming from China and U.S. by investigating their online ratings and reviews. From two major online review communities, customer ratings and reviews have been retrieved, quantified, text-mined, compared, and interpreted using statistics, latent Dirichlet allocation, and frequency analysis. Results suggest that Chinese tourists are less inclined to assign lower ratings to restaurants, and are more strongly fascinated by the food offered, whereas U.S. tourists are more apt to be fun-seeking, and are less uncomfortable with crowdedness."

This study aimed to compare the domestic Chinese and foreign English-speaking customers’ dining experience of Beijing Roast Duck, a specialty food representing the gastronomic identity of the local cuisine. By employing semantic network analysis of the online consumer reviews, the results identified three common dimensions perceived by both groups, including the food, the restaurant and the occasion for dining out, and the service encounter. However, the domestic and foreign customers differed in their orientation about the aspects of the service encounter that they cared about. They also showed substantial differences in their perception about value for money as well as the cultural and experiential nature of the meal. The study also attested to the utility of the semantic network analysis method to uncover the rich information contained in the vast user generated content online."
